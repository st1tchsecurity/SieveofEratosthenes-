# Sieve of Eratosthenes <br>
A solution for a codewars Kata. <br>

# Breaking Down the Code
**Letâ€™s break down the function:**

**Sieve of Eratosthenes (sieve_of_eratosthenes function):** This function generates all prime numbers up to n. It creates a list of boolean values representing the numbers up to n (all initialized as True), then iteratively marks the multiples of each number starting from 2 as False (not prime). The function also creates a dictionary (primes) where the keys are the prime numbers and the values are the counts of even digits in each prime number.

**Counting even digits:** This is done within the sieve_of_eratosthenes function. For each prime number, it counts the number of even digits.


**Finding the prime with the most even digits:** After generating the primes and counting their even digits, the function finds the maximum count of even digits (max_even_digits). It then finds and returns the largest prime number that has max_even_digits even digits and is less than n.

And there you have it! A unique problem solved with a blend of number theory and Python. This solution is efficient and should work well for large inputs. However, please note that it can use a significant amount of memory for very large inputs due to the list of primes.

I hope you found this walkthrough helpful and interesting. Happy coding!
